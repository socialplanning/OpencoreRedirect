[2:18pm] ltucker: ianbicking: you've got the urlmapper split out and checked in somewhere ?
[2:18pm] whit: ok... if this is just something I need for local testing I won't sweat it
[2:18pm] ianbicking: ltucker: well, it's checked in, but not at all tested
[2:19pm] ianbicking: and the actual urlmapper implementation we need isn't checked in yet
[2:19pm] ltucker: ianbicking: okay
[2:19pm] ianbicking: though I think our implementation will be just a half dozen lines or so
[2:19pm] whit: ltucker: do we need the zope config view to emit events to update stuff elswhere(eventually?)
[2:20pm] ltucker: whit: yeah we're going to want to send a message to the urlmapper for projects and subprojects
[2:20pm] whit: alright... will set that up
[2:21pm] ltucker: ianbicking: ok. you mean the special openplans mojo ?
[2:21pm] magicbronson_ joined the chat room.
[2:21pm] ianbicking: urlmapper won't need to know about, but dvhoster will
[2:22pm] ltucker: ianbicking: which the project / subproject event?
[2:22pm] ianbicking: well, project we can guess at if it's projectname.openplans.org
[2:22pm] ltucker: ianbicking: I thought that was the thing that set the project header? or is that still dvhoster ?
[2:22pm] ianbicking: but subproject definitely (and project wouldn't hurt)
[2:22pm] ianbicking: the project header is dvhoster
[2:22pm] ltucker: ok
[2:22pm] ianbicking: and urlmap then can read that
[2:22pm] ianbicking: so when you add a subproject "subproject" to project "project"
[2:22pm] ianbicking: you'd do:
[2:23pm] ianbicking: PUT http://project.openplans.org/.deliverance/remote_uris content=[..., {'path': '/subproject', 'headers': {'X-Project-Name': 'subproject'}}]
[2:23pm] ianbicking: though I just remembered I also wanted a POST version, but I forgot about it
[2:24pm] ianbicking: so you could POST to http://project.openplans.org/.deliverance/remote_uris?add with a single-item list
[2:24pm] ianbicking: or for delete POST to http://projects.openplans.org/.deliverance/remote_uris?delete with [{'path': '/subproject'}]
[2:25pm] whit: "project" is variable or a special url?
[2:26pm] ianbicking: "project" would be the variable
[2:26pm] ianbicking: the actual project name
[2:27pm] whit: this would work the same way for full domain mapping too right?
[2:30pm] ianbicking: yes; the init_domain function guesses that the project name is "project" based on the domain name (project.openplans.org)
[2:30pm] ianbicking: but if that guess can't be made (or isn't right) then it'd need that suggestion
[2:30pm] ianbicking: in that case you'd have "path": "" (meaning the root of the site), instead of "path": "/subproject"
[2:34pm] whit: so, the three times zope might need to inform vhoster of something:
[2:34pm] whit: project creation
[2:35pm] whit: a project gets redirected to a new domain
[2:35pm] whit: a subproject is added
[2:35pm] whit: am I missing anything?
[2:35pm] ianbicking: deletion
[2:36pm] ianbicking: but yeah
[2:36pm] whit: yup
[2:36pm] whit: rename?
[2:36pm] ianbicking: project rename?  Err... yeah
[2:36pm] ianbicking: but I think you can treat that like a delete and add
[2:36pm] whit: yup
[2:36pm] ianbicking: domain rename has to be done differently
[2:37pm] whit: like we are no longer greenpeace but now greenpeas?
[2:37pm] ianbicking: you do PUT /.deliverance/domain with the new domain name as the body (not JSON, just a straight string)
[2:38pm] ianbicking: so like PUT http://greenpeace.openplans.org/.deliverance/domain content=greenpeas.openplans.org
[2:39pm] ianbicking: it will automatically set up an alias then, so all requests to greenpeace.openplans.org get redirected to greenpeas.openplans.org
[2:39pm] whit: I'm copying this transcript, but is there a place where this is all more or less documented in the vhoster?

ianbicking: I mostly outlined it here: http://www.openplans.org/projects/deliverance/lists/deliverance-discussion/archive/2007/01/1168372208532/forum_view
