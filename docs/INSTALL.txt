OpenCoreRedirect Installation
=======================

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run

 * Create a file called ``OpenCoreRedirect-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="opencore.redirect" />
